        If this option is checked, Jenkins makes it possible to set an environment
        for the Job by defining environment variables and execute a script (a setup script).<br/>
        After the set up, only injected variables (with Jenkins variables)
        will be available in the build scripts, in the Jenkins post-actions, and so on. <br/>
        Variables provided by the Jenkins process (inherited variables) will not be available by default.
