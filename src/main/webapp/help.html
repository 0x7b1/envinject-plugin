        If this option is checked, Jenkins tries to replace inherited variables provided by the Jenkins process by defining a clean environment.<br/>
        That makes it possible to inject environment variables. <br/>
        Only environment variables injected will be available in the build scripts, in the Jenkins post-actions, and so on.
