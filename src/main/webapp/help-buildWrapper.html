        Add or override environment variables to the whole build process.<br/>
        The variables will be injected after a SCM checkout (workspace elements are available).<br/>
        If you don't want to depend on the default environment variables (environment variables inherited by the Jenkins
        process), we suggest using 'Prepare an environment for the job' in the top of the configuration file to set a
        clean environment.
