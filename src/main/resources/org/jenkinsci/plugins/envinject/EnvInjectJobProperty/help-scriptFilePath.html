        Executes a script file aimed at set an environment such a create folders, copy files, and so on.<br/>
        Gives the script file path. <br/>
        You must give an absolute path (the process is executed before a SCM checkout).
        You can use the above properties variables. <br/>
        However, adding or overriding environment variables in the script has no impact in the build job.
