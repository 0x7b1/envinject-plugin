        If enabled, load files (properties or scripts) from the master node.
        Without check this option, Jenkins loads the files from the target node (slave/agent or master).
        Loading the files from the master may enable you to avoid conflicts between to have a generic
        path, such as the problematic between Windows and Linux when your job is not attached to a specific node.
        Anyway, the file will be processed from the target node.

        Starting from EnvInject 2.0, this option may take no effect if the feature is disabled globally.
        In such case you will see a notice in the option display name.
        Once the option is saved with <code>false</code>, it will dissappear from the UI.

        It is <b>not recommended</b> to use this option in new jobs even if it is enabled.
