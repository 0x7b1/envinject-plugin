        Executes a script file aimed at set an environment such a create folders, copy files, and so on.<br/>
        Gives the script file path. <br/>
        The file path can be relative to the workspace (the process is executed before a SCM checkout) or absolute.<br/>
        You can use the above properties variables. <br/>
